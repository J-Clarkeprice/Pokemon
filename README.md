Hello and welcome to the pokemon application I created. 

This application is designed to allow people to have fun while they play Pokemon.
While still ealier in development, I aim to have this application contain all the pokemon from all generations 1-9

The file Core.py currently holds the main code for running this application. Through the use of sqlite I am storing the data for the pokemon and moves in a .db file called Data.db. I am also putting in the data for all the different moves as well. This data is seperated into two different tables called Moves and Pokemon. I am getting the data from an online website called pokemon database. I have put below the total number of pokemon and moves I have added to the .db file.

Moves Count: 301
Pokemon Count: 186

Currently I haven't added any of the mega evolutions or Alolan versions of pokemon. It is intended to add both Mega Evolutions and Alolan versions at a later date.

If your viewing the data from the Data.db file using the command line, the following commands make it more user friendly to see: .headers on and .mode column
