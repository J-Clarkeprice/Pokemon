Hello and welcome to the pokemon application I created. 

This application is designed to allow people to have fun while they play Pokemon.
All Pokemon from generation 1-9 are in the application.
I haven't added different Pokemon variations such as Alolan or Mega Evolutions.

The file Core.py currently holds the main code for running this application. I am storing all data for the 
application in the .db file called Data.db. I am also putting in the data for all the different moves as well.
This data is seperated into two different tables called Moves and Pokemon. I am getting the data from an online
website called pokemon database.
