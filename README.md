Hello and welcome to the pokemon application I created. 

This application is designed to allow people to have fun while they play Pokemon.
While still ealier in development, I aim to have this application contain all the pokemon from all generations 1-9

The file Core.py currently holds alot of the main code for running this application. Through the use of sqlite I am storing the data for the pokemon in a .db file called Pokemon.db. I am getting the pokemon data from an online website called pokemon database. I have put below the total number of pokemon I have added to the .db file.

Pokemon Count: 80

Currently I haven't added any of the mega evolutions or Alolan versions of pokemon. It is intended to add both Mega Evolutions and Alolan versions at a later date.
